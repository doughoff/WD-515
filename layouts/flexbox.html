   * The flex property is a short-hand for setting
   * the flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis

   * element resizes to fill its container.
   *
   * The value we're using here is actually the
   * default, but I'm including so I can explain it
   * a bit. The default value equates to:
   *
   * - flex-grow: 0
   * - flex-shrink: 1
   * - flex-basis: auto
   *
   * We set flex-grow to 0, so this element won't
   * expand to fill its container.
   *
   * We'll then set flex-shrink to 1 so that the
   * element will shrink as its container gets
   * smaller. However, it will only shrink so far
   * because...
   *
   * ...we set flex-basis to auto. This causes
   * the content's size to also be a factor in the
   * calculation of the element's size. Because
   * the width of a child element is set (below),
   * this element won't shrink below that size.
   But is also causes the area not to wrap so, it's out. - DH
   *
   * The net result is that this element stays a
   * fixed size, neither expanding nor shrinking.

     * briefly summarize here:
     *
     * - display: flex instructs the browser to
     *   use flexbox to lay out this element's
     *   children.
     * - justify-content: center will center the
     *   icon along the main axis.
     * - align-items: center will center the icon
     *   along the secondary (perpendicular) axis.

   * We'll use the short-hand flex property again
   * here, to make the body of the post expand to
   * fill the container, and shrink as the container
   * becomes narrower.
   *
   * By setting flex-grow to 1, we cause this
   * element to expand to fill the container.
   *
   * Setting flex-shrink to 1 causes this element
   * to shrink with the container.
   *
   * Last, we set flex-basis to 0 so that its
   * size is solely determined by the size of
   * the container. (The default value is auto,
   * which would cause the content's size to also
   * be a factor in this calculation.)
   *
   * The net result of these properties is that the
   * element is a fluid size, and will expand and
   * shrink with its container.
   *
   * NOTE: IE11 ignores flex short-hand declarations
   * with unitless flex-basis values. So we have to
   * use 0% instead of 0 as a workaround. You can
   * find more info at:

                the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language
                ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is
                a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing
